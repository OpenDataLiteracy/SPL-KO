# Interview Questions for SPL Regional Managers

## Introduction

**About me:** My name is Karalyn Ostler. I am a Master of Library and Information Science graduate student at the University of Washington. I will be entering my second and final year in the program this fall. I am really interested in data science and data curation and how those concepts fit into everyday workflows of librarians. I have lived in the greater Seattle area for my whole life and am really interested to see what this project will reveal about the community.

**ODL Internship:** The University of Washington Information School's Open Data Literacy (ODL) project works with public institutions to create, manage and publish open data. These projects range from working with data policy to curating datasets for publication.

**SPL and ODL:** I will be working with SPL to identify and transform relevant external and internal open datasets into actionable intelligence for frontline staff. Based on the information collected in this interview, I will identify datasets and transform them into easily understandable materials. The goal of this project is to provide SPL staff at many different branches in the SPL system information that they can use to make better informed decisions and create better services. 

## Questions for Regional Manager

The goal from this interview is to get to know what you and your staff are currently or soon-to-be working on and might want additional outside information about.  

Are there any special projects or concerns your staff will be addressing this summer or upcoming year that you would like to have additional information about (e.g. about the community or environment)?  


What do you want to know about the community or environment that could help you plan services for your library? Or if you could know anything about the community to better serve SPL, what would it be?  


Here are a few suggestions from David Christensen:
- Weather data (high heat days): look at weather data with temperatures in the summer and see which days had high heat. Using data about library use (door counts, computer use, check out data) see if there is a correlation between high temperatures and library use. This information could potentially be used to plan closures and other services. This might be of particular interest to Carnegie libraries and other libraries without air conditioning. This could also be applied to the winter weather, like snow days and closures.
- Smoke data: Similar to the high temperature data, look at past summer data to identify days with high smoke levels and see if there was an effect on library use or services. Did more people come to the libraries when there were high smoke levels, or did it prevent them from coming in? This could be useful for planning closures and other services centered on the air quality of the city.
- Construction data: Look at the various construction projects near SPL branches and see if there has been an impact on services or may have impact on services in the future. This could be useful for particular branches in heavy construction areas where accessibility may be affected.
- Event data: Similar to the construction data, looking at permits for major events in Seattle and see if they have had an impact on library usage. This could be used to plan staffing or security or closures.
- Beyond census data, other community data: Look at specific parts of the community, like housing or education. This information could be used to plan future services centered around a certain part of the community, especially specific projects centered around employment, children, or education.


How would you like to see the findings from this project? Presentation? Written report? Both?  


Are you okay getting updates or answering questions if more information is needed in the upcoming weeks?
