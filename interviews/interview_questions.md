# Interview Questions for SPL Regional Managers

## Introduction

ODL Internship: The University of Washington Information School's Open Data Literacy (ODL) project works with public institutions to create, manage and publish open data. 

SPL and ODL: Karalyn will be working with SPL to identify and transform relevant external and internal open datasets into actionable intelligence for frontline staff. Based on the information collected in this interview, Karalyn will identify datasets and transform them into easily understandable materials.

## Questions for manager

What do you want to know about the community or environment that could help you plan services for your library?  


Here are a few suggestions from David Christensen:
- Weather data (high heat days): look at weather data with temperatures in the summer and see which days had high heat. Using data about library use (door counts, computer use, check out data) see if there is a correlation between high temperatures and library use. This information could potentially be used to plan closures and other services.
- Smoke data: Similar to the high temperature data, look at past summer data to identify days with high smoke levels and see if there was an effect on library use or services.
- Construction data: Look at the various construction projects near SPL branches and see if there has been an impact on services or may have impact on services in the future.
- Event data: Looking at permits for major events in Seattle and see if they have had an impact on library usage.
- Beyond census data, other community data: Look at specific parts of the community, like hosing,
