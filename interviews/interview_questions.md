# Interview Questions for SPL Regional Managers

## Introduction

**About me:** My name is Karalyn Ostler. I am a Master of Library and Information Science graduate student at the University of Washington. I will be entering my second and final year in the program this fall. I am really interested in data science and data curation and how those concepts fit into everyday workflows of librarians. I have lived in the greater Seattle area for my whole life and am really interested to see what this project will reveal about the community.

**ODL Internship:** The University of Washington Information School's Open Data Literacy (ODL) project works with public institutions to create, manage and publish open data. These projects range from working with data policy to curating datasets for publication.

**SPL and ODL:** I will be working with SPL to identify and transform relevant external and internal open datasets into actionable intelligence for frontline staff. Based on the information collected in this interview, I will identify datasets and transform them into easily understandable materials. The goal of this project is to provide SPL staff at many different branches in the SPL system information that they can use to make better informed decisions and create better services. 

## Questions for Regional Manager

Are there any special projects or concerns your staff will be addressing this summer or upcoming year that you would like to have additional information about?  


What do you want to know about the community or environment that could help you plan services for your library?  


Here are a few suggestions from David Christensen:
- Weather data (high heat days): look at weather data with temperatures in the summer and see which days had high heat. Using data about library use (door counts, computer use, check out data) see if there is a correlation between high temperatures and library use. This information could potentially be used to plan closures and other services. This might be of particular interest to Carnegie libraries and other libraries without air conditioning. This could also be applied to the winter weather, like snow days and closures.
- Smoke data: Similar to the high temperature data, look at past summer data to identify days with high smoke levels and see if there was an effect on library use or services. Did more people come to the libraries when there was high smoke levels or did it prevent them from coming in?
- Construction data: Look at the various construction projects near SPL branches and see if there has been an impact on services or may have impact on services in the future.
- Event data: Looking at permits for major events in Seattle and see if they have had an impact on library usage.
- Beyond census data, other community data: Look at specific parts of the community, like housing or education. This information could be used to plan future services centered around a certain part of the community.
