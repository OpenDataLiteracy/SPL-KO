# Justification for Interviews

## Scope and Goals:
- What is the purpose of conducting interviews?
The purpose of conducting interviews for this project is to collect information about the data needs of frontline staff directly from those who will be using the finding of this project. To maximize the usefulness of the findings from this project, these interviews will allow me to get to know what SPL staff are doing at the various branches and tailor the project to current SPL needs. 
- Are you trying to answer specific questions, if so what are they? 
The specific question I am trying to answer is, what information about the community or environment would be most useful for planning future services, advocacy, or events?
- What are key concepts and definitions of key terminology of study? 
**Open data:** Data that is freely available for reuse. These data are usually posted in public repositories in the form of tables or spreadsheets. Open data covers a range of subjects and are usually posted by the organization that collected it.
**Data Transformation:** Most data come in the form of spreadsheets or other tabular files and it can be hard to see patterns or other useful intelligence. By using certain software, data can be visualized or manipulated to highlight the useful information in the datasets.
- Who are stakeholders of your findings?
The stakeholders of my findings from these interviews will be other SPL staff, the general public, and possibly the other public libraries. The information found from the interviews will inform this project and give a general idea of what SPL is currently planning.

Sampling: 
- Who is eligible to be a participant in your study?
Regional Managers and other SPL staff with knowledge of current SPL services. 
- What are criteria for being included in study (e.g. What makes an eligible participant relevant?)
The hope is that Regional Managers will be able to provide a general overview of the needs of several SPL branches. If the Regional Managers do not feel they have enough knowledge of current SPL services for their branches, they may refer to another SPL staff member who is closer to the planning and day-to-day operations.
- How many participants (raw number, in particular category of participants, etc) are necessary to meet project goals? 
This project will start with interviewing 2 Regional Managers. If more information is needed, more SPL staff may be contacted.

Recruiting and Participating: 
- How will participants be recruited? 
Participants will be recruited based on suggestions from project mentor and availability.
- How will they agree to participate? 
Participants will be contacted via email. 
- Where will interviews take place?
Interviews will be conducted via phone.
- What will you do with the recordings / transcripts?
Recordings will be kept for duration of the project. The recordings will be used as a source of notes for informing the rest of the project's progression.
