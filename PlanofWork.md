# Seattle Public Library: Beyond Census Data

## Description  
ODL intern Karalyn Ostler will help the project sponsor, Seattle Public Library (SPL), identify, extract and transform lesser-used relavent external open data into actionable intelligence for frontline staff. Karalyn will start with assessing the data needs of frontline staff at SPL, asking staff to describe information about the community that would help them plan future services. From the information gathered, Karalyn will identify open datasets from open data sources, like the City of Seattle Open Data portal and State of Washington open data portal, that can be used to address these data needs. Using using Python or R and other data visualization softwares, Karalyn transform the datasets into more useful and easy to understand objects, including but not limited to graphs, maps, and written reports. This process will be throughly documented so that similar future projects can build off of this work and new data can be added to expand materials. Stakeholders served include SPL, SPL frontline staff and the general public that they serve.


## Goals     
What is this project supposed to achieve, and why?

- **Assess data needs of SPL frontline staff:** Karalyn will talk to frontline staff at SPL to assess thier data needs. Specifically, she will ask them what information about the local community would be most helpful for them to make better informed decisions 
- **Identify relevant open datasets related to Seattle:** Karalyn will search through several open data repositories with relevant Seattle community data to find datasets that can be used to 
- **Create materials using datasets for use by SPL staff:** Karalyn will transform selected open datasets into visualizations and reports for frontline staff.
